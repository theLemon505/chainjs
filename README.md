# chainjs
a data based html link system for page navigation

USAGE:
to use chain js first download the chainjs file and include it in your html project

  EX:
  ```html
  <script src="chain.js"></script>'
  ```

you may also use the raw link
  EX:
  ```html
  <script src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XuiZEtoi_uW_ck447vGJwsrzCvxQVrdN"></script>
  ```
after doing this you may ade chain links. chain links are links to html code files that may be loaded in or out of a project

once you have added your html files you may link them to the index using chain-node elements, these with load html content without changeing the url

  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-node link="test.html"></chain-node>
  ```
  
you may pass parameters for if you want your page to be loaded with the "if" statement

  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-node if="0 === 0" link="test.html"></chain-node>
  ```  

you may also use varibles with the chain-var element

  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-var id="var_id" val=0></chain-var>
  <chain-node var="var_id" varif=0 if="0 === 0" link="test.html"></chain-node>
  ```
  
use the "function" attribute to run custom functions in the html code
  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-node function="console.log('hello')" link="test.html"></chain-node>
  ```
  ```text
  hello
  ```
  
add the "and" attribute if you would like to render the html only if both the "if" and "varif" are true
  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-var id="var_id" val=0></chain-var>
  <chain-node and="true" var="var_id" varif=0 link="test.html"></chain-node>
  ```

if you would like to change the page url to another html file use the chain-link, it is the dame as the chain-node in all of the usages exept that it changes the url
  EX:
  ```html
  <chain-var id="var_id" val=0></chain-var>
  <chain-link and="true" var="var_id" varif=0 link="test.html"></chain-link>
  ```
